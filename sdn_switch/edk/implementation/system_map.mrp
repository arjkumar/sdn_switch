INFO:

   Logic has been added to automatically put the DCMs in auto-calibration
   mode if the clock input or clock feedback ever stops. This is recommended
   to ensure that the DCMs will maintain maximum operating frequency for the
   following Virtex-4 devices: Production Step 2 for LX/SX, and all Productions
   for FX.  The extra logic insertion can be disabled by placing the
   DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION=FALSE attribute on each applicable DCM or by setting
   the environment variable XIL_DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_OFF.  For more information
   regarding the DCM auto-calibration mode, please consult Answer Record 21435.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
4691 block(s) removed
 857 block(s) optimized away
5362 signal(s) removed
2876 Block(s) redundant

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.

* Slices can be packed with basic elements from multiple hierarchies.
  Therefore, a slice will be counted in every hierarchical module
  that each of its packed basic elements belong to.
** For each column, there are two numbers reported <A>/<B>.
   <A> is the number of elements that belong to that specific hierarchical module.
   <B> is the total number of elements from that hierarchical module and any lower level
   hierarchical modules below.
*** The LUTRAM column counts all LUTs used as memory including RAM, ROM, and shift registers.
