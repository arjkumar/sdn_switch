WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1843 - One or more MGTs are being used in this design.
   Evaluate the SelectIO-To-MGT Crosstalk section of the Virtex-4 RocketIO
   Multi-Gigabit Transceiver User Guide to ensure that the design SelectIO usage
   meets the guidelines to minimize the impact on MGT performance.
